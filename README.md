# Project experience with Languages
I am fluent in many languages, including (English,Thai ,Chinese,Japaness). These language skills not only enable me to better understand people from different cultural backgrounds, but also enable me to participate more extensively in exchanges and cooperation in the field of international business administration.
During my time at university, I conducted an in-depth study of linguistics, especially in the area of cross-cultural communication and language barriers. I have been involved in projects that explore how effective communication and language skills can promote teamwork and organizational development. I also examine the impact of cultural differences in different linguistic contexts on the business environment and how language skills can be used to address challenges in cross-cultural communication. These research experiences have made me more aware of the importance of language in the business world and stimulated my interest in actively helping to solve language problems in my work.
